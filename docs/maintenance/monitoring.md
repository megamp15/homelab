# Monitoring Your Homelab

## Coming Soon!

This section is currently under development as I learn more about monitoring solutions for my homelab environment.

### Planned Topics

- Setting up Prometheus and Grafana
- System resource monitoring
- Service availability monitoring
- Network monitoring
- Alert configuration
- Dashboard creation

Check back later for detailed guides and best practices for monitoring your homelab infrastructure.

## Current Approach

For now, I'm using basic monitoring through the built-in tools in Proxmox and TrueNAS SCALE, along with occasional manual checks of system resources.

## Resources for Learning

Some resources I'm exploring for homelab monitoring:

- [Prometheus Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [Grafana Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/)
- [TrueNAS SCALE Monitoring Features](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/)
- [Proxmox Monitoring](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Monitoring)
